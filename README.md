# Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Equipment Using IoT Data

This project aims to develop a predictive maintenance system that utilizes IoT sensor data to predict equipment failures in an industrial setting. By identifying patterns in sensor data, the system forecasts when machines will likely need maintenance, thereby reducing downtime and maintenance costs.

## Project Objectives

- **Predictive Maintenance**: Forecast equipment failure using IoT sensor data.
- **Data Integration**: Combine real-time sensor data with historical maintenance logs.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual behavior in equipment performance.
- **Cost Analysis**: Compare predictive maintenance with traditional maintenance approaches.

## Project Phases

1. **Data Collection**
   - Gather IoT sensor data from industrial equipment (e.g., temperature, vibration, pressure).
   - Collect historical maintenance logs and external factors like environmental conditions.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Clean and preprocess sensor data (handle missing values, remove noise).
   - Perform time-series analysis and feature extraction (e.g., average, max, min).

3. **Failure Prediction Modeling**
   - Implement machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
   - Use time-series forecasting techniques like ARIMA or LSTM.
   - Perform feature selection to identify key data points affecting machine health.

4. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Apply algorithms like Isolation Forest to detect anomalies.
   - Use clustering techniques (e.g., DBSCAN) to find outliers in sensor readings.

5. **Model Evaluation and Optimization**
   - Evaluate models using metrics such as Precision, Recall, and RMSE.
   - Optimize models through cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

6. **Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts**
   - Develop a real-time monitoring system to track equipment health.
   - Set up alerts for the maintenance team based on predictive analysis.

7. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**
   - Compare predictive maintenance to traditional maintenance.
   - Present potential savings in maintenance costs.
